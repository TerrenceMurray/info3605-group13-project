================================================================================

This document summarizes all route redistribution points in the network topology.

================================================================================
ROUTING DOMAINS
================================================================================

1. OSPF Domain (Area 0):
   - OR1 (1.1.1.1)
   - OR2 (2.2.2.2)
   - OR3 (3.3.3.3) - OSPF/EIGRP boundary
   - OR4 (4.4.4.4)
   - RR3 (100.100.100.3) - OSPF/RIP boundary

2. EIGRP Domain (AS 100):
   - OR3 (boundary router)
   - ER15 (connected to OR3 Fa0/1 at 16.3.110.0/24)

3. RIP Domain (Version 2):
   - RR3 (boundary router)
   - Additional RIP routers (connected to RR3)

================================================================================
REDISTRIBUTION POINT 1: OR3 (OSPF <-> EIGRP)
================================================================================

Router: OR3
Router ID: 3.3.3.3
File: i39_startup-config.cfg

OSPF Configuration:
-------------------
router ospf 1
 router-id 3.3.3.3
 log-adjacency-changes
 redistribute eigrp 100 subnets          <- EIGRP routes into OSPF
 passive-interface FastEthernet0/1       <- EIGRP-facing interface
 network 16.3.112.0 0.0.0.255 area 0     <- To OR2
 network 16.3.113.0 0.0.0.255 area 0     <- To OR4

EIGRP Configuration:
--------------------
router eigrp 100
 redistribute ospf 1 metric 10000 100 255 1 1500  <- OSPF routes into EIGRP
 passive-interface FastEthernet0/0      <- OSPF-facing (to OR4)
 passive-interface FastEthernet1/0      <- OSPF-facing (to OR2)
 network 16.3.110.0 0.0.0.255           <- EIGRP network (to ER15)
 no auto-summary

Interfaces:
-----------
Fa0/0: 16.3.113.2 -> OR4 Fa1/0 (OSPF)
Fa1/0: 16.3.112.1 -> OR2 Fa0/0 (OSPF)
Fa0/1: 16.3.110.1 -> ER15 Fa2/0 (EIGRP)

Expected Behavior:
------------------
- OSPF routes (16.3.59.0/24, 16.3.60.0/24, 16.3.111.0/24, 16.4.21.0/24, etc.)
  should appear in EIGRP domain as "D EX" (external EIGRP routes)

- EIGRP routes from 16.3.110.0 network should appear in OSPF domain as
  "O E2" (OSPF external type 2 routes)

Verification Commands:
----------------------
OR3# show ip route ospf          ! See OSPF-learned routes
OR3# show ip route eigrp         ! See EIGRP-learned routes
OR3# show ip route | include E2  ! See EIGRP routes redistributed as OSPF E2
OR3# show ip protocols            ! Verify redistribution config

On other OSPF routers (OR1, OR2, OR4):
OR1# show ip route | include E2  ! Should see EIGRP routes as O E2

On EIGRP routers (ER15):
ER15# show ip route | include EX ! Should see OSPF routes as D EX

================================================================================
REDISTRIBUTION POINT 2: RR3 (OSPF <-> RIP)
================================================================================

Router: RR3
Router ID: 100.100.100.3
File: i17_startup-config.cfg

OSPF Configuration:
-------------------
router ospf 1
 router-id 100.100.100.3
 log-adjacency-changes
 redistribute rip subnets                <- RIP routes into OSPF
 passive-interface FastEthernet0/0       <- RIP-facing interface
 passive-interface FastEthernet0/1       <- RIP-facing interface
 network 16.4.20.60 0.0.0.3 area 0       <- OSPF network

RIP Configuration:
------------------
router rip
 version 2
 redistribute ospf 1 metric 5            <- OSPF routes into RIP
 passive-interface default
 no passive-interface FastEthernet0/0    <- RIP active interfaces
 no passive-interface FastEthernet0/1
 no passive-interface FastEthernet1/0
 network 16.0.0.0
 no auto-summary

Expected Behavior:
------------------
- OSPF routes (16.3.59.0/24, 16.3.60.0/24, 16.3.111.0/24, 16.3.112.0/24, etc.)
  should appear in RIP domain with metric 5

- RIP routes should appear in OSPF domain as "O E2" (OSPF external type 2)

Verification Commands:
----------------------
RR3# show ip route ospf          ! See OSPF-learned routes
RR3# show ip route rip           ! See RIP-learned routes
RR3# show ip route | include E2  ! See RIP routes redistributed as OSPF E2
RR3# show ip protocols            ! Verify redistribution config

On other OSPF routers (OR1, OR2, OR3, OR4):
OR1# show ip route | include E2  ! Should see RIP routes as O E2

On RIP routers:
RIP-Router# show ip route rip    ! Should see OSPF routes via RIP

================================================================================
ROUTE TAG CONSIDERATIONS
================================================================================

IMPORTANT: Route redistribution can cause routing loops if not configured
properly. Both OR3 and RR3 are redistributing into OSPF.

Current Configuration Status:
- No route filtering configured
- No route tagging to prevent loops
- No distribute-lists applied

Potential Issue:
----------------
If RR3 and OR3 can reach each other via OSPF (they can - both in Area 0),
there's a potential for suboptimal routing:

1. EIGRP route -> OR3 -> OSPF (as O E2) -> RR3 -> RIP
2. RIP route -> RR3 -> OSPF (as O E2) -> OR3 -> EIGRP

Both redistributed routes will appear as O E2 in OSPF, so OSPF routers
might not choose the optimal path.

Recommendation:
---------------
If routing issues occur, consider:
- Setting different OSPF external metric types (E1 vs E2)
- Using route tags and distribute-lists
- Adjusting OSPF external metrics
- Using route maps for more granular control

For now, basic redistribution should work for this topology.

   [ ] show ip protocols - verify both redistributions
   [ ] show ip route ospf - see routes from OSPF domain
   [ ] show ip route eigrp - see routes from EIGRP domain
   [ ] show ip route | include E2 - see EIGRP routes as OSPF external

   [ ] show ip protocols - verify both redistributions
   [ ] show ip route ospf - see routes from OSPF domain
   [ ] show ip route rip - see routes from RIP domain
   [ ] show ip route | include E2 - see RIP routes as OSPF external

3. On pure OSPF routers (OR1, OR2, OR4):
   [ ] show ip route | include E2 - should see external routes from both
       EIGRP (via OR3) and RIP (via RR3)
   [ ] show ip route 16.3.59.0 - verify VLAN 311 route exists
   [ ] show ip route 16.3.60.0 - verify VLAN 321 route exists

4. On EIGRP routers:
   [ ] show ip route eigrp - should see OSPF routes as D EX

5. On RIP routers:
   [ ] show ip route rip - should see OSPF routes via RIP metric 5

6. End-to-end connectivity:
   [ ] PC311 can ping PC321 (inter-VLAN)
   [ ] PCs can reach devices in EIGRP domain
   [ ] PCs can reach devices in RIP domain

================================================================================
SUMMARY
================================================================================

Two redistribution points configured:

1. OR3: Bidirectional OSPF <-> EIGRP redistribution
   - EIGRP metric: 10000 100 255 1 1500
   - OSPF routes become D EX in EIGRP
   - EIGRP routes become O E2 in OSPF

2. RR3: Bidirectional OSPF <-> RIP redistribution
   - RIP metric: 5
   - OSPF routes propagate into RIP with metric 5
   - RIP routes become O E2 in OSPF

All routers in OSPF domain should be able to reach all networks across
all three routing domains (OSPF, EIGRP, RIP) via these redistribution points.
